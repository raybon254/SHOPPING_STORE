## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for front-end logic.
* **HTML:** The standard markup language for creating web pages.
* **CSS:** Used for styling the look and feel of the application.

## 🚀 Usage (Local Development)

To run the Shopping Store in development mode on your local machine, follow these instructions:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node Package Manager (npm) installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LARRYKIPKURUI/Group-3-Shopping-Cart.git](https://github.com/LARRYKIPKURUI/Group-3-Shopping-Cart.git)
    cd shopping-store
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will install all the necessary packages and libraries listed in the `package.json` file.

4.  **Start the Development Server:** In your project directory, run the following command to start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the front-end application on a local development server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

5.  **Start the Mock Backend:** Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project directory again. Then, run the following command to start the JSON Server, which serves as a mock backend for this project:
    ```bash
    json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
    ```
    This command will start a simple REST API based on the data in the `db.json` file, ensuring it runs on port 3000 to align with the frontend's default API calls.

6.  **Open in Your Browser:** Once the front-end server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the React development server (usually `http://localhost:3000`). You should now be able to see and interact with the Shopping Store website.
